# 1 - Introduction and design of the Network Diagram

In this project, I will build a Cybersecurity Homelab using VirtualBox. I am aiming to build a complete system using open source and free tools.

The project will be divided into several parts, starting with the high-level design of the lab, and then gradually building each component.

Other home lab projects that I used as inspiration and reference:

Feel free to replicate my project and create your own. The foundations will be similar, but the possibilities are endless! ðŸš€
