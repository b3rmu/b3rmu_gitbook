# 4. Ingesting Data

The project structure has been created and Sentinel has been deployed; however we still have no data to visualize. If the Logs tab is visited, it will be seen that no tables or events are available.

In a real deployment we will connect the different data sources that our company wants to monitor, for example, Windows Event Logs, Office365, Azure Activity, AWS...

For the purposes of this project, I would like to have the data available quickly and ready for analysis. Therefore, I will be utilizing the sample data provided by the Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab solution.

Search Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab solution, it will appear under Marketplace.

The deployment in my case lasted about 15 minutes, grab a cold beer and chill üç∫üòé

Deployment completed!

Let's now return to Sentinel and select the workspace. Then, select Incidents on the left menu, under the Threat Management tab. You will notice that some incidents have been triggered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you get some errors and the incidents doesn't appear don't panic, wait a few minutes more and they will appear.
{% endhint %}

Also, if we go to Logs tab and execute a `search *` we will see that now we have events available!
