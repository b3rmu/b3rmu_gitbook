If you did not follow the previous page, no problem, just go to this link and click on Login.

The portal will look like this:

To deploy Sentinel, you need the Azure Portal and an active subscription, plus a Resource Group and a Log Analytics Workspace. Let's make it happen!



### Creating an Azure Resource Group

First, I think we should understand what is an Azure Resource group and why its important:

"_An **Azure Resource Group** is a logical container in Microsoft Azure that holds related resources for an application or service._

_Resources in Azure can include virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, virtual networks, and more. When using Microsoft Sentinel, a resource group is essential for organizing and managing these resources._" - [https://medium.com/@nbkumar2103/-cab49effc7b6](https://medium.com/@nbkumar2103/-cab49effc7b6)



Let's create one, click Resource groups.

Click on Create.

Keep Azure subscription 1 as it is the only one we will have, name the Resource group and select our Region. Click on Review and create.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CAUTION** It seems that Sentinel is not yet supported to run in central Spain, I had to create another resource group and workspace and locate them in east US ðŸ˜ª To avoid encountering this issue, please verify that your region is supported.
{% endhint %}

Review the data and click on Create at the bottom of the page.

Taraaaaaaaan! Our first resource is ready!

### Creating a Log Analytics Workspace

What is and why we need a Log Analytics Workspace?

The Log Analytics Workspace is fundamental for Sentinel since it stores all the data it analyzes to generate alerts, incidents and reports. These are its key functions:

* Stores logs from different sources such as: Firewalls, Windows machines, Linux machines, Cloud services and much more. The storage time is configurable.
* Centralises and normalises all the information received from very different sources. Each source sends different data, here it is normalised and organised so that we can work with it.
* Allows event analysis and threat detection using the KQL language.
* Reports and workbooks can be created, as well as a variety of other functionalities.

To create our Log Analytics Workspace we will look for this name in the portal. Click on the option shown in the image.

Click on any of the two Create buttons.

We choose our subscription and the Resource group we created earlier. We give a descriptive name to the workspace and select the Region. Click on Review + Create.

{% hint style="info" %}
As with Resource Group, please verify that your Region is supported before creating the workspace.
{% endhint %}

We wait for it to validate and click on Create.

We wait for Microsoft Log Analytics (Operations Management Suite) to deploy. When it is finished, we are ready to install Sentinel!
